# AlwaysStrong — keybox revocation check.
#
# keybox_check.sh answers "will keymint accept this document?". This answers the
# other half: "will Google accept it?". They are different questions with the
# same symptom. A structurally perfect keybox whose leaf certificate has been
# revoked passes every local check, is loaded by keymint without complaint, and
# still fails every Play Integrity verdict — because the verdict is decided on
# Google's servers, against attestation/status, where the serial is listed. No
# local file can look wrong in that case, so the only way to catch it is to read
# the same list Google reads.
#
# Public keybox mirrors are the usual source of a revoked keybox: the key is
# shared by everyone who uses the mirror, so the moment it leaks it is revoked,
# and the mirror keeps serving it until someone notices.
#
# Usage: sh keybox_revoke_check.sh <keybox.xml> <status.json>
#
# Exit:
#   0  none of the keybox's certificates is on the list
#   1  REVOKED — at least one is; each hit is printed as "REVOKED serial=... reason=..."
#   2  cannot tell (missing arguments, no certificate found, no usable tools)
#
# Every certificate is checked, not just the leaf: a revoked intermediate is
# just as fatal, and the chain in a keybox is short enough that the extra work
# is not worth the special case.
