# Scan installed modules for known conflicts with AlwaysStrong and disable
# them. Called at install time (customize.sh) AND on every boot (service.sh),
# because users do install conflicting modules after AlwaysStrong is already
# in place, and the symptoms (TEE getting hooked twice, target.txt fights,
# zygisk double-hooks) look like AlwaysStrong is broken.
#
# Disabling rather than deleting on every boot: the user's root manager
# may already have processed the module list; a `disable` marker is honored
# by Magisk/KSU/APatch at next boot, while `remove` schedules deletion.
# We do both, plus rm -rf for already-applied state. customize.sh handles
# install-time bulk removal; this script handles steady-state monitoring.

# Build-spoof (PIF-family) modules. They double-hook the bundled PlayIntegrityFork
# on the Fork/inject lines, so those lines disable them. The PIF-less "Lite" line
# ships NO Build spoof and is meant to run alongside the user's own PIF, so Lite
# KEEPS these — removing them there is exactly what stopped Lite + PlayIntegrityFork
# from working.
