# OhMyKeymint — early (post-fs-data stage) setup.
#
# post-fs-data.sh calls this before anything else touches keystore2. It mirrors
# upstream OMK's own post-fs-data.sh plus the state-dir half of its
# customize.sh, so the supervisor loops that start at the service stage find a
# usable runtime instead of creating one mid-boot.
#
# Two roots are hardcoded inside the OMK binaries and cannot be relocated:
#   /data/misc/keystore/omk   runtime state — keybox.xml, injector.toml,
#                             config.toml, rpc.sock, logs/. Must be owned by the
#                             keystore uid (1017) at mode 0770 or keystore2
#                             cannot reach the RPC socket.
#   /data/adb/omk             supervisor state — pidfiles, restart flags,
#                             injector.payload. Upstream also links
#                             omkdata -> /data/misc/keystore/omk from here.

# Seed the two files keymint/injector read at startup, so a fresh install is not

# the keybox; omk-sync.sh owns both files from here on. config.toml is
# deliberately NOT pre-created: keymint generates its [crypto] secrets when it
# writes the file the first time, and inventing them ourselves would break every
# key created before the next reinstall.
#
# The seed is validated first. This runs before keymint starts, so a file copied
# here is the one keymint parses on its very first attempt — and a file keymint
# refuses is worse than no file at all: it rewrites its bundled template
# (DeviceID="sw") instead of keeping whatever was there, which turns all three
# Play Integrity verdicts red. Leaving the path empty instead lets keymint create
# its own template and omk-sync.sh replace it with a good keybox later.

# --- config.toml rescue ---------------------------------------------------
# config.toml holds the generated [crypto] seeds, and OMK derives the key that
# protects every blob it has ever minted from root_kek_seed. Its own docs are
# explicit that a missing file at keymint start makes it mint a new one with new
# seeds, and that this does not restore keys protected by the previous seeds —
# the whole store becomes undecryptable and keymint dies with
#   failed to decrypt keyblob: ... VerificationFailed ...
#   fatal startup error: failed to initialize boot-level key cache
# after which omk-daemon drops the store, taking GMS's attestation keys with it.
# omk-sync.sh parks a copy of the last complete file next to our state, so put it
# back before keymint starts instead of letting OMK invent new seeds. Only a file
# still carrying all four generated fields is accepted — a half-written one would
# poison the restore.
