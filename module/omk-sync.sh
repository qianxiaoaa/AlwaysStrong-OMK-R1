# OhMyKeymint — mirror AlwaysStrong's config dir into OMK's runtime dir.
#
# Everything the user configures lives under /data/adb/tricky_store (keybox.xml,
# target.txt, security_patch.txt). OMK cannot read any of it: its two files are
# hardcoded to /data/misc/keystore/omk and are written in its own formats. This
# script is the bridge, and it runs on every boot, on every [Action] tap, on the
# hourly pass, and from service.sh's watchdog.
#
# It is idempotent and safe at any boot stage:
#   - the keybox half is a plain file comparison;
#   - the scoop half only rewrites injector.toml when the package set actually
#     changed;
#   - the config.toml half is skipped entirely until keymint has created that
#     file (it generates the [crypto] secrets, and those must never be touched).
#
# Exit code: 0 when something was changed and OMK needs to re-read it, 1 when
# nothing changed. Callers may ignore it.
#
# Only the keybox and config.toml need a keymint restart — keymint reads both
# once at start. injector.toml is watched and hot-applied to new requests, so a
# target-list edit must NOT bounce keymint (that would drop in-flight keystore
# operations for every app, for a change OMK picks up on its own).

# previous keybox when it rejects a new one — it rewrites its bundled template
# (DeviceID="sw", a placeholder chain Google cannot verify), and every Play
# Integrity verdict goes red. Refusing to copy an unusable file leaves the last
# good keybox in place, which is the difference between one red verdict and

# --- 2. scoop (target.txt -> injector.toml) ------------------------------
# target.txt is TrickyStore's format: one package per line, an optional `!`
# (generate) or `?` (hack) suffix, and `[file.xml]` section headers for apps
# pinned to another keybox. OMK's scoop is a flat list of exact package names
# with no suffixes and no sections, so the suffixes are stripped and the header
# lines are rejected by the package-name filter below.
#
# Apps sitting inside a `[file.xml]` section are kept, deliberately. OMK has one
# runtime keybox and no per-app keybox, so the alternative — dropping them —
# would leave exactly the apps the user asked to attest on the system backend,
# which is the failure this engine exists to avoid. Attesting them with OMK's
# keybox is the closest faithful behaviour available; a user who needs a truly
# different keybox per app has to run OMK on its own.

# --- 3. config.toml [trust] ---------------------------------------------
# The two switches OMK reports through key attestation, plus os_version. This is
# the half that actually moves DEVICE/STRONG: without device_locked=true OMK
# reports an unlocked bootloader and the verdict stays red no matter how good
# the keybox is.
#
# The four patch-level fields stay on "auto" on purpose. Three of them
# (security_patch / os_patchlevel / vendor_patchlevel) resolve from the runtime
# build props that sync_patch.sh pins to the attested date. boot_patchlevel does
# NOT: OMK reads com.android.build.boot.security_patch out of the active top-level
# vbmeta image first, so it reports the ROM's own boot date whatever the props
# say. Writing an explicit date here would make OMK overwrite the property itself,
# which fights sync_patch.sh's "never move a device's patch backwards" rule on an
# OTA-fresh device.
#
# vb_hash / vb_key stay on the engine's own derivation unless the user drops a
# pinned value in the config dir. OMK's "auto" reads the device's verified boot
# state, which on a custom ROM whose vbmeta carries no authentication block still
# produces a correctly-computed digest — one that simply matches no certified
# build. The documented escape is to pin the two 64-hex digests taken from an
# unmodified stock image of the same build. Absent or malformed files leave both
# keys exactly as they are: "auto" remains the default and the safer answer.
