# Fork's zygisk reads custom.pif.prop, which only its own migrate.sh can produce
# from a pif.prop. Its spoof flags are numeric.

#                          engine (TEESimulator-RS) supplies the hardware-attested

#   spoofVendingFinger=1   Play Store build spoof.
# Any of these can be overridden per-key from the WebUI Advanced tab, which
# writes `key=value` lines into /data/adb/tricky_store/spoof.conf. Some wallet /
# banking apps only pass with a flag flipped (e.g. spoofProps=0 on a Poco F8
# Pro). engine_enforce_spoof re-applies these on every boot/hourly pass, so an
# override in spoof.conf survives — without it a flipped flag would silently
# revert an hour after boot.
#
# Three flags are dangerous: spoofProvider / spoofSignature / spoofVendingSdk
# each make the PIF zygisk intercept the very keystore calls the attestation
# engine (TEESimulator-RS) answers, so the two fight and Play Integrity goes red on
# all three verdicts. A spoof.conf carried over from an earlier, non-TEE install
# is the usual way they get left on, and it silently breaks every verdict.
#
# They are NOT locked out — an app that genuinely needs one must be able to have
# it. Instead the engine strips them ONCE from an inherited spoof.conf
# (engine_migrate_spoof_conf), so an upgrade can't inherit a broken config, and
# from then on honours whatever the user picks in the WebUI Advanced tab, where
# those three rows carry a warning about the consequence.
