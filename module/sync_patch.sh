# AlwaysStrong — keep the security patch level consistent across three places:
#   1. /data/adb/tricky_store/security_patch.txt  — the patch level a
#      TrickyStore-style engine stamps into the hardware attestation.
#   2. *.security_patch in the active pif file    — what PIF's zygisk reports to
#      GMS and to every app it hooks.
#   3. ro.build.version.security_patch system props — what Build.VERSION and the
#      apps PIF does NOT hook read. TEESimulator-RS's PatchLevelManager keeps its
#      patch fields on "prop", so the engine's attestation follows these props too.
#
# All three must carry the SAME date: attestation checkers flag a mismatch
# between the OS patch (props) and the attested osPatchLevel (security_patch.txt
# / the engine). Earlier versions could drift apart two ways — the hourly
# refresh only rewrote security_patch.txt, and turning patch spoofing off moved
# the props to the real date while the other two stayed spoofed. Both are gone:
# every landing point is written from one computed value, EFF.
#
# Which date EFF is:
#   - default: the fingerprint's own SECURITY_PATCH — the pre-r3 behaviour, and
#     the only combination that is internally consistent for a canary
#     fingerprint (its patch can never postdate its own build).
#   - opt-in (/data/adb/tricky_store/unified_patch_date — the WebUI's "Unified
#     patch date" test row): the newer of the fingerprint's date and the ROM's
#     real one, so an OTA that outruns the fingerprint keeps the newer real date.
#   - opt-out (/data/adb/tricky_store/no_spoof_patch_props): the ROM's real date
#     everywhere — nothing is spoofed on any of the three.
#
# The ROM's real patch is captured by post-fs-data.sh before anything pins the
# props, into $CONFIG_DIR/.rom_security_patch.
#
# Usage:
#   sh sync_patch.sh         # security_patch.txt + pif only (install / hourly)
#   sh sync_patch.sh boot    # also pin the system props (post-fs-data / Action)
